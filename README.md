The code and the data are used in the manuscript "Seasonal divergence between soil water availability and atmospheric moisture recorded in tree-ring d18O extremes". The authors include Guobao Xu et al. The manuscript are submitted to ERL. The code will be changed after review comments. If you used our data and code, please cite Xu et al 2020 Environ. Res. Lett. https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab9792.  
To run the code, you need to download the data and change the path of the data. Some of the functions are needed. If you want to run the code, please ask for my R function. We used ggplot package to produce the figures. If you have any other questions, please contact me by email: xgb234@lzb.ac.cn or guobaoxu@email.arizona.edu.
We run the code in R 3.5.1 for windows 10 system.
